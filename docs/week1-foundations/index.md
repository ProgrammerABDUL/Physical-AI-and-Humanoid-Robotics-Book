# Week 1-2: Foundations of Physical AI & Sensors

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI - the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems. We'll explore how AI algorithms can be embodied in physical robots to interact with the real world.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the principles of Physical AI
- Learn about different types of sensors used in robotics
- Gain familiarity with the course tools and platforms
- Set up your development environment

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI that operates on abstract data to AI systems that interact with and operate in the physical world. Unlike classical AI that processes text, images, or other digital information, Physical AI systems must deal with:

- Real-time constraints
- Uncertainty in sensor data
- Complex dynamics of physical systems
- Safety considerations
- Embodiment in physical form

## Sensor Technologies

Robots perceive the world through various sensors. Understanding these sensors is crucial for building effective Physical AI systems:

### Vision Sensors
- RGB cameras for color image capture
- Depth sensors (LiDAR, stereo cameras, structured light)
- Thermal cameras for heat detection

### Proprioceptive Sensors
- IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) for orientation and acceleration
- Encoders for joint position feedback
- Force/torque sensors for contact detection

### Environmental Sensors
- GPS for outdoor positioning
- Microphones for audio input
- Temperature, humidity, and other environmental sensors
